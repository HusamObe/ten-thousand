Define a GameLogic class in ten_thousand/game_logic.py file.
Handle calculating score for dice roll
Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the rollâ€™s score according to rules of game.

* chatGPT replies with code and:
>in this implementation, the calculate_score method takes a tuple roll as input, which represents a dice roll. It uses a counting approach to calculate the score based on the rules provided in the comments.
You can use this implementation as a starting point and modify it further to fit your specific game rules if necessary.

```python
class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(roll):
        # Calculate the score for the given dice roll

        # Score rules:
        # - A single 1 is worth 100 points
        # - A single 5 is worth 50 points
        # - Three of a kind (except for 1s) are worth 100 times the number (e.g., three 4s are worth 400 points)
        # - Three 1s are worth 1000 points
        # - Additional 1s in a three of a kind group are worth 100 points each
        # - Additional 5s in a three of a kind group are worth 50 points each

        score = 0

        # Count the occurrences of each number in the roll
        counts = [roll.count(i) for i in range(1, 7)]

        # Calculate the score based on the counts
        for number in range(1, 7):
            count = counts[number - 1]

            if count >= 3:
                if number == 1:
                    score += 1000
                else:
                    score += number * 100

                # Deduct the count of three from the original count
                count -= 3

                # Add additional points for extra 1s or 5s
                if number == 1:
                    score += count * 100
                elif number == 5:
                    score += count * 50

            # Add individual points for 1s and 5s
            if number == 1:
                score += count * 100
            elif number == 5:
                score += count * 50

        return score

Handle rolling dice
Add roll_dice static method to GameLogic class.
The input to roll_dice is an integer between 1 and 6.
The output of roll_dice is a tuple with random values between 1 and 6.
The length of tuple must match the argument given to roll_dice method.

* chatGPT replied with code and :
>In this updated implementation, the roll_dice static method takes an num_dice argument, which is an integer between 1 and 6 representing the number of dice to roll. It uses the random.randint function to generate random values between 1 and 6 for each dice, and stores them in a tuple. The length of the tuple will match the num_dice argument.
You can use this method to roll the dice and obtain a tuple of random values to simulate the dice roll in your game.

```python
import random

class GameLogic:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_score(roll):
        # Score calculation implementation...
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(num_dice):
        # Roll the dice and return the values as a tuple

        # Ensure the number of dice is between 1 and 6
        num_dice = max(1, min(6, num_dice))

        # Generate random values for each dice
        diceroll = tuple(random.randint(1, 6) for  in range(num_dice))

        return dice_roll
```
